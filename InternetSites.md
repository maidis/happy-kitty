# Happy Kitty Wiki #
You are here right now :) We need to document every game shortly. Also we must write documents about Happy Kitty processes and tools that we use. This is where users can help the most.

# Happy Kitty SVN #
First, this is not a playground. If you want a playground you can open a new project at [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/support/). Happy Kitty is a source package repository. Everything must work in the repository. All packages must be placed to the right place. Games must be in games directory, libraries in libraries directory :) I do not know a good document about SVN. But I'm sure you can find one by [searching on Google](http://www.google.com.tr/search?q=svn+howto).
