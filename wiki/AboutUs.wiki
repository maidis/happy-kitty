== About Happy Kitty ==

Happy Kitty is an unofficial project with the mission to provide open source and redistributable freeware games for the latest Pardus Linux release.

The Happy Kitty repository extends the official repositories by providing new games.

There is a short and limited testing phase instead of a full testing cycle to ensure packaging quality, however it is less strict than Pardus's official requirements. You may also be interested on [http://code.google.com/p/happy-kitty/wiki/PackageRepositories#Pardus other unofficial Pardus repositories].

There is no company behind this project. It is managed, maintained, developed and supported by a volunteer group and by the users themselves.

Your help is needed and appreciated.
