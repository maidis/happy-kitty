|| Xrick is the Linux version of Rick Dangerous which is hard and funny platform game. Way before Lara Croft, back in the 1980's and early 1990's, Rick Dangerous was the Indiana Jones of computer games, running away from rolling rocks, avoiding traps, from South America to a futuristic missile base via Egypt and the Schwarzendumpf castle. || <wiki:video url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrntyEWtKSg"/> ||
