|| JVGS takes place in a world much like ours, which has started fading away. At a point where nearly everything has gone, a poet finds himself, alone in a strange world of danger. He starts a journey along the broken stream of thoughts that's left. || <wiki:video url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UauZgrnKp0c"/> ||
