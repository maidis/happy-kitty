#summary This is really hardest part and a draft only for now.

== As Happy Kitty User ==
To become a Happy Kitty user does not need to do anything special. Just add Happy Kitty repository to your Pardus system and enjoy games. But if you want to do more:
  * Make requests for new packages,
  * Report errors in existing packages,
  * Mention us,
  * Be one of our sponsor
  * Be Happy Kitty Wiki writer, packager, developer, or project owner
  * ...


== As Happy Kitty Wiki Writer ==


== As Happy Kitty Packager ==
Anyone who can make a package for Pardus be a packager at Happy Kitty. There are just some of the conditions. Using Pardus. Love to playing and packaging. Know at least a basic level of programming. Like research and debugging...

Happy Kitty doesn't have an exact policy yet. This is only a primitive state of such a future document. Just a draft.

Here's the plan. Do one of the following tasks and be one of the first packagers at Happy Kitty. They often will not be easy. Beware of dragons because you are crunchy and taste good with ketchup!
