|| MegaGlest is a 3D realtime strategy game, where you control the armies of one of seven different factions: Tech, Magic, Egyptians, Indians, Norsemen, Persian or Romans. This project is a fork of the original RTS, Glest. It aims to improve the game and its content with a particular focus on network play. || <wiki:video url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Ez8mc_PUY"/> ||
