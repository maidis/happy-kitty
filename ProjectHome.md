## Welcome to Happy Kitty ##

We are proud to present to you our first project that provides game related packages to the [Pardus](http://www.pardus.org.tr/eng/) gamers and game developers.

Not sure what game you want? Just looking for something new to kill some time? Couldn't find libraries that you need to develop your game? You are definitely in the right place. Happy Kitty is perfect for you. All packages are well categorized and we offer a comprehensive list. To see what games, libraries, and tools we recently offer, check out [package list](http://code.google.com/p/happy-kitty/wiki/PackageList) page.
