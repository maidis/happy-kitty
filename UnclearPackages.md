# Introduction #

Happy Kitty only includes open source and redistributable freeware softwares in its repository. As a result of this, some packages will never be added to the repository. We aim with Happy Kitty to create a full of game related packages repository entirely from free and open source software. But sometimes there may be some situations that not fully clear. The purpose of this document is help to make easy to follow this type packages and make decisions.
